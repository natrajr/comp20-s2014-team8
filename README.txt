README for CryptoTicker

Created by Seth Kahn and Rohan Natraj

The features we've correctly implemented are the following:
	-- A news page that displays links to news articles relevant to cryptocurrencies
	-- An exchange rate page that displays exchange rates for various cryptocurrencies with
			other real-world currencies. This accepts a user-selected currency and displays
			the appropriate data for said currency
	-- A market data page for Bitcoin that displays a graphical representation of Bitcoin's
			value over time, with time spans specified by the user
	-- Fully integrated navigation bar
	-- A landing page to precede navigation to main features

This project was made possible by the collaboration between Rohan Natraj and Seth Kahn.

Approximately 50 hours of collaborative effort were spent on this project.
